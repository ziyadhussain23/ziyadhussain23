*   **Cloud-Native Auto-Scaling:** Deployed on AWS EC2 with an Auto Scaling Group triggered by custom **CloudWatch metrics** (e.g., active room count > 50). The system automatically provisions new instances during high load and drains connections gracefully during scale-in.
*   **Resilient System Design:** Integrated **Resilience4j** circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures in external service calls and implemented token-bucket rate limiting (1000 req/sec) to protect API endpoints from abuse.
*   **Multi-Tier Security:** Secured with JWT stateless authentication (access/refresh tokens), HttpOnly cookies, role-based access control (RBAC) for granular permissions (e.g., Interviewer vs Candidate), and AES-256 encryption for data at rest.

**Key Achievements:**
*   🚀 **High Concurrency:** Successfully stress-tested to handle **100+ concurrent video sessions** with **<50ms latency** in signaling.
*   ⚡ **Performance:** Achieved **sub-100ms API response times** for 95% of requests through multi-level caching (Caffeine L1 + Redis L2).
*   📉 **Efficiency:** Reduced operational costs by **40%** by utilizing Spot Instances for stateless backend nodes and optimizing database queries with proper indexing strategies.
*   🛡️ **Reliability:** Maintained **99.9% uptime** during simulated load tests using chaos engineering principles to test failover mechanisms.
